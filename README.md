## General info
While trying to learn more about C# and ASP.net I have created this small app that saves jokes to an SQL server. 
Only users who are logged in can manipulate the jokes but anyone can see them and search through them.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* C#
* .NET
* SQL

## Setup
Firstly clone this repo. Once downloaded, open appsettings.json, you will see a key "DefaultConnection", inside that string value you
will need to put your own database name that the app will connect to.

## Features
* Login/out and register
* Database to hold all the jokes
* CRUD operations

## To-do list:
* Show which user posted the joke
* Add an email sender

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
